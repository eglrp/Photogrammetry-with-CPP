GeographicLib is a C++ library similar to GeoTrans.  It performs primarily coordinate conversions,
similar to Proj.  For many functions, GDAL/OGR may be enough.  Where GeographicLib really shines is
its support for gravity models, geoid models, and magnetic models.  It also contains the utilities to 
find and import the required data.

Another strong feature of GeographicLib is support for MGRS.  While MGRS is part of the 
GDAL NITF driver, it is not natively supported.  GeographicLib makes this much easier.
