\subsection*{Spherical Coordinate System}

Most users are familiar with this first class of coordinates, defined as a \emph{spherical}
coordinate system.  This is commonly referred to the \emp{latitude} and \emph{longitude}.
Spherical coordinates in mathematics typically take the form of $r, \theta,$ and $\phi$ where
$r$ is the radius from the center to the coordinate, $\theta$ is the angle on the x,y plan,
and $\phi$ is the angle from the z axis to xy plane.  Figure \ref{fig:figure_1_1} shows
