# Photogrammetry-with-CPP
Photogrammetry using C++

For a long time I have been wanting to write a technical book.  After doing some 
technical reviewing, I think I have enough appreciation and knowledge to start
this effort.  In particular, I have a strong passion for cartography and 
photogrammetry.  I want to write a book which shares my passion for photogrammetry
using common C++ libraries.  My goal is to enable intermediate to advanced
C++ developers the ability to write applications which take advantage of
all the power that modern cartography enables. 


Please contact me with any questions, comments, or advice.  I am not the worlds
greatest writer, so please feel free to help me along.  If there is any specific
information you would like to see, please let me know.
